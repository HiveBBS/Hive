## APP IDEAS

1. Build database (~100) [CO2 emissions](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) or [Global Burden of Disease/IHME Data](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019)
2. Build back-end to learning platform (such as Canvas)
3. Text-based game?
4. Online bulletin board (e.g. Craigslist), use socket.io to send DMs to buyer/seller, auth/auth

# Final Pitch

-   **Name of Project:** BBS
-   **Problem Domain:** We want to create a bulletin board system that will allow a user to post an item for sale to a wide audience.
<!-- (What problem or pain point does it solve? a. Keep it high level without going into too much detail. (3-4 sentences is enough)) -->
-   **MVP:** System will allow a user to:\
	- sign up\
	- sign in\
	- subscribe to a channel or topic to receive notifications\
	- add an item for sale to a database that generates a message to subscribers
<!-- (Minimum Viable Product (MVP): what is the minimum required for you to present on your demo day?) -->
-   **Stretch goal:** Create multiple channels on a variety of topics
-   **Stretch goal:** Post a message to a message board
-   **Stretch goal:** Send a direct message to another user
