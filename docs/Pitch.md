## APP IDEAS

1. Build database (~100) [CO2 emissions](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2) or [Global Burden of Disease/IHME Data](http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-2019)
2. Build back-end to learning platform (such as Canvas)
3. Text-based game?
4. Online bulletin board (e.g. Craigslist), use socket.io to send DMs to buyer/seller, auth/auth
